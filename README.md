## üéØ Project Objectives

This project is implemented to:

- Introduce basic Python syntax such as variables, data types, and mathematical operations.
- Learn the control structure of the program flow ('if', 'for', and 'while').
- Use built-in functions and create your own functions.
- Understand data manipulation with structures such as 'list' and 'dictionary'.
- Apply programming logic in solving simple problems.
