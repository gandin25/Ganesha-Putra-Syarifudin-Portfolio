# [Project 1 - Titanic Data Analythic](https://github.com/gandin25/Titanic-Data-Analythic/blob/main/Titanic_Data_Analythic_assignment_Ganesha.ipynb)
Welcome to the **Titanic Data Analytics** project! This project is designed as a practical introduction to Python programming and data analytics using a real-world dataset‚Äîthe Titanic passenger manifest. It combines Python fundamentals with beginner-level data exploration and basic analysis.

---

## üéØ Project Purpose

The project is created with the aim to:

- Introduce basic Python syntax including variables, data types, and arithmetic operations.
- Understand control flow (`if`, `for`, `while`) and user-defined functions.
- Learn how to read, explore, and analyze datasets using Python.
- Apply logical thinking to solve real-world problems through code.
- Use basic data analytics techniques to uncover insights from the Titanic dataset.

---

## üèÜ Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python programming for future data science projects.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets.
- Develop critical thinking and analytical skills.
- Learn to perform simple exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Practice writing clean, well-structured Python code.

---

## ‚úÖ Project Outcomes

- Successfully executed various Python basics (math operations, conditionals, loops, functions).
- Explored and analyzed the Titanic dataset using:
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Basic visualizations
  - Summary statistics
- Generated insights about survival rates based on gender, class, and age.
- Demonstrated the ability to combine programming logic with data-driven questions.

This project was created as part of the fulfillment of the final project of the Mini Bootcamp Digital Skill Fair 38.0 organized by Dibimbing.id.

# [Project 2 - Introduction Python](https://github.com/gandin25/Titanic-Data-Analythic/blob/main/Ganesha_Putra_Syarifudin_introduction_python.ipynb)
Welcome to the *Introduction to Python* project! This project is designed as part of the basic learning of Python programming, aimed at providing beginners with a fundamental understanding in order to build a strong foundation in programming logic.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

This project is implemented to:

- Introduce basic Python syntax such as variables, data types, and mathematical operations.
- Learn the control structure of the program flow ('if', 'for', and 'while').
- Use built-in functions and create your own functions.
- Understand data manipulation with structures such as 'list' and 'dictionary'.
- Apply programming logic in solving simple problems.

---

## üèÜ Goals

1. Understand the basic logic of Python programming.
2. Write and execute code to solve simple problems.
3. Build a foundation for learning advanced topics such as data science and machine learning.
4. Develop logical thinking skills and  methodical.
